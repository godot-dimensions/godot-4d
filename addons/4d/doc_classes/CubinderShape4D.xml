		A 4D cubinder shape.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		CubinderShape4D is a shape created by extruding a 3D cylinder into 4D space. It is defined by a radius of a circle in the XZ plane, a height in the Y direction, and a thickness in the W direction. The cubinder is centered at the origin. If you want a cubinder in a different orientation, you can rotate the [CollisionShape4D] node the cubinder is attached to.
