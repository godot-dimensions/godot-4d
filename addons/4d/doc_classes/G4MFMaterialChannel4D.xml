	<brief_description>
		Represents a single channel of a G4MF material, such as the base color, normal map, or emission properties.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		G4MFMaterialChannel4D is a class for material channels inside of a [G4MFMaterial4D]. A material channel is a single property of a material, such as [member G4MFMaterial4D.base_color_channel], [member G4MFMaterial4D.normal_channel], [member G4MFMaterial4D.emissive_channel], and [member G4MFMaterial4D.orm_channel]. The colors in a material channel may represent actual colors, or may be more abstract data, such as a normal map's color values encoding the normal vectors of a surface.

		<method name="from_dictionary" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="G4MFMaterialChannel4D" />
			<param index="0" name="dict" type="Dictionary" />
			<description>
				Converts the given [Dictionary] representing the JSON of a G4MF material channel to a [G4MFMaterialChannel4D]. This will set the fields of the [G4MFMaterialChannel4D] and [G4MFItem4D] classes based on the data in the [Dictionary].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_equal_exact" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="other" type="G4MFMaterialChannel4D" />
			<description>
				Checks if the [G4MFMaterialChannel4D] is equal to another [G4MFMaterialChannel4D] exactly by checking if the properties are equal and all accessor indices refer to the same accessors. If a material channel refers to a different accessor, even if the data is the same, this will return [code]false[/code]. The name of the material channel is not checked, and any metadata is ignored.

		</method>
		<method name="to_dictionary" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<description>
				Converts the G4MF material channel to a [Dictionary]. This is used for serializing the G4MF material channel as JSON.

		<member name="element_map_binding" type="G4MFMeshSurfaceBinding4D" setter="set_element_map_binding" getter="get_element_map_binding">
			The binding that defines per-item values (such as colors), and indices which map these to elements, for this material channel. If not defined, the surface uses only the [member factor] and/or the mapped texture for its values or colors.
		</member>
		<member name="factor" type="Color" setter="set_factor" getter="get_factor" default="Color(-1, -1, -1, -1)">
			The modulate factor of the surface, also known as the value or single base color. If non-negative, this is per-component multiplied with other properties to get the final color of the cells and edges, or if no other properties are defined, this is the only color used.
		</member>
		<member name="texture_index" type="int" setter="set_texture_index" getter="get_texture_index" default="-1">
			The index of the [G4MFTexture4D] in the [G4MFState4D]'s textures array that contains the texture for this surface. This is per-component multiplied with the [member single_color] and the cell colors to get the final color of the cells. If not defined, the surface does not have a texture.
			[b]Note:[/b] This property is currently not used when generating a [Material4D] from a [G4MFMaterial4D].
		</member>
		<member name="texture_map_binding" type="G4MFMeshSurfaceBinding4D" setter="set_texture_map_binding" getter="get_texture_map_binding">
			Override for the mesh surface's texture map binding. If defined, this binding is used instead of the mesh surface's [member G4MFMeshSurface4D.texture_map_binding] to map the texture onto the surface.
