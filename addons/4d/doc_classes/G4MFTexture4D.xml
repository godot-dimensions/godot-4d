		Texture for G4MF material cells.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		G4MFTexture4D is a class for textures in the G4MF format. It is used to define the texture of a [G4MFMaterialChannel4D], which affects the appearance of the [G4MFMaterial4D] and therefore any [G4MFMeshSurface4D] that uses the material.
		Each texture may contain multiple images, which may construct textures of different dimensions based on the size property. Images may be cut and assembled together into higher-dimensional textures than the image formats themselves support, such as using multiple 2D images to construct a 3D texture, until all pixels in the texture are filled. Additionally, images of unknown formats should be skipped, allowing further images may be used as fallbacks, or the placeholder color if no images are usable.

				Converts the given [Dictionary] representing the JSON of a G4MF texture to a [G4MFTexture4D]. This will set the fields of the [G4MFTexture4D], [G4MFFileReference4D], and [G4MFItem4D] classes based on the data in the [Dictionary].

		<member name="images" type="G4MFFileReference4D[]" setter="set_images" getter="get_images" default="[]">
			The images property is a [G4MFFileReference4D] array of that defines the images used by the texture. If not specified or empty, the texture has no images. Images SHOULD NOT contain embedded color space profiles (ICC profiles) or other metadata that alters the visual appearance of the image. This is to ensure that the image is displayed consistently in applications that do not support color spaces or other visual-affecting metadata.
			Images may be cut into multiple tiles if their width and height exceeds the [member texture_size]'s first two numbers and is still a multiple of them, allowing single images to contain many layers which may be assembled into a 3D texture. However, images MUST NOT be smaller than the [member texture_size]'s first two numbers, meaning that images MUST NOT be stitched together on their sides.

		<member name="mag_filter" type="String" setter="set_sampler_mag_filter" getter="get_sampler_mag_filter" default="&quot;linear&quot;">
			The magnification filter is a string-based enum that defines the filter mode of the texture when magnified. Meaning, how the texture is sampled when zooming in on a texture or looking closely at a texture on a surface, resulting in the texture being larger on the screen than its original size. Valid values are "linear", "nearest", and any additional values defined by extensions. For pixel art graphics, this is the property that should be set to "nearest" to avoid blurring, while the other filter properties can be left at their defaults.
		</member>
		<member name="min_filter" type="String" setter="set_sampler_min_filter" getter="get_sampler_min_filter" default="&quot;linear&quot;">
			The minification filter is a string-based enum that defines the filter mode of the texture when minified. Meaning, how the texture is sampled when zooming out on a texture or looking at a texture from a distance, resulting in the texture being smaller on the screen than its original size. Valid values are "linear", "nearest", and any additional values defined by extensions. The "nearest" value can result in aliasing artifacts, but is cheaper to calculate.
		</member>
		<member name="mipmap_filter" type="String" setter="set_sampler_mipmap_filter" getter="get_sampler_mipmap_filter" default="&quot;linear&quot;">
			The mipmap filter is a string-based enum that defines the filter mode of the texture when mipmaps are used. Meaning, how the texture is sampled when mipmaps are used, which are precomputed lower-resolution versions of the texture. This setting is used together with "minFilter" to determine the appearance during minification. Valid values are "linear", "nearest", "none", and any additional values defined by extensions. The "none" value means that mipmaps are not used, which reduces memory usage but can result in low performance and aliasing artifacts when the texture is scaled down. If the "mipmapFilter" is set to a value other than "none", mipmaps SHOULD be generated by the application on import, since mipmap data is not stored in G4MF files.

		<member name="placeholder_color" type="Color" setter="set_placeholder_color" getter="get_placeholder_color" default="Color(0, 0, 0, 1)">
			The placeholder color is the color to use when no images are available. This property is required and has no default value. This value is NOT a modulate color applied to the texture. It is only used when the texture cannot fill the given pixels due to no images being available, such as when the "images" array is empty, all image formats are unsupported, or there is not enough image data to fill the texture.
		</member>
		<member name="texture_size" type="PackedInt32Array" setter="set_texture_size" getter="get_texture_size" default="PackedInt32Array()">
			The texture size is an array of integers that defines the size or resolution of the texture in pixels. This property is required and has no default value. The array MUST have at least one item, and each item MUST be a positive integer, not zero or negative. The length of the array defines the dimension of the texture.
		</member>
		<member name="wrap_modes" type="PackedStringArray" setter="set_sampler_wrap_modes" getter="get_sampler_wrap_modes" default="PackedStringArray()">
			The wrap mode is an array of strings that defines how the texture is wrapped when sampling outside of the texture bounds. The length of the array MUST either be 1 or equal to the number of dimensions in the texture. If only one wrap mode is specified, it applies to all axes. If multiple wrap modes are specified, they apply to each axis in the order of the texture's dimensions. The default value is to repeat the texture in all dimensions.
