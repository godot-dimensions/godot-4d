		Handles processing of G4MF files.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		G4MFDocument4D contains functions for importing and exporting G4MF files. It uses a [G4MFState4D] as data storage, which allows G4MFDocument4D to be stateless.
		When importing a G4MF file, a [G4MFState4D] can be populated by G4MFDocument4D by reading a file. This data can then be used to create a Godot scene or a mesh resource.
		When exporting a Godot scene, a [G4MFState4D] can be populated by G4MFDocument4D by converting the scene. This data can then be used to save to a G4MF file.

			<description>
				Part of the export process. Populates a [G4MFState4D] with data from a Godot [Mesh4D]. This may be used instead of [method export_append_from_godot_scene], or after it. This function will not add any nodes to the [G4MFState4D], only a mesh.

			<description>
				Part of the export process. Populates a [G4MFState4D] with data from a Godot scene. To export a scene to a G4MF, first call this function, then call [method export_write_to_file].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="export_write_to_byte_array">
			<return type="PackedByteArray" />
			<param index="0" name="g4mf_state" type="G4MFState4D" />
			<description>
				Part of the export process. Writes a [G4MFState4D] to a [PackedByteArray] in memory. The data is always the Good 4D model Binary format. This is useful if you want to send the data over a network or save it to a file later.
				To export a scene to a G4MF, first call [method export_append_from_godot_scene], then call this function, or [method export_write_to_file] if you want the data on disk instead of in memory.

			<param index="0" name="g4mf_state" type="G4MFState4D" />
			<param index="1" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Part of the export process. Writes a [G4MFState4D] to a G4MF file on disk at the given [param path]. The file may have a [code]".g4tf"[/code] file extension to export it as a Good 4D model Text File, or a [code]".g4b"[/code] file extension to export it as a Good 4D model Binary file.
				To export a scene to a G4MF, first call [method export_append_from_godot_scene], then call either this function, or [method export_write_to_byte_array] if you want the data in memory instead of on disk.

			<param index="1" name="which_mesh_index" type="int" default="-1" />
			<param index="2" name="include_invisible" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Part of the import process. Generates a Godot [Mesh4D] from the G4MF data in a [G4MFState4D].
				If [param which_mesh_index] is set to -1 (default), and the G4MF data contains nodes, the nodes will be used to determine the transforms of the mesh instances and generate a combined mesh. The combined mesh will only be tetrahedral if every mesh in the G4MF data can be generated as a tetrahedral mesh and [member G4MFState4D.force_wireframe] is set to [code]false[/code], otherwise the combined mesh will be wireframe.
				If [param which_mesh_index] is set to a valid mesh index, only that mesh will be generated exactly as-is, and any other meshes will be ignored. Otherwise, if the G4MF data does not contain nodes, the mesh at index 0 will be generated.

			<param index="0" name="g4mf_state" type="G4MFState4D" />
			<description>
				Part of the import process. Generates a Godot scene from a [G4MFState4D]. To import a G4MF file, first call [method import_read_from_file], then call this function. The returned node can be added to the scene tree or saved as a PackedScene.

			<description>
				Part of the import process. Reads a G4MF file from a [PackedByteArray] in memory and populates a [G4MFState4D]. To import G4MF data in memory, first call this function, then call [method import_generate_godot_scene]. If the G4MF data is in a file, use [method import_read_from_file] instead.

				Part of the import process. Reads a G4MF file at the given [param path] and populates a [G4MFState4D]. To import a G4MF file, first call this function, then call [method import_generate_godot_scene]. This can be used with either a [code]".g4tf"[/code] Good 4D model Text File or a [code]".g4b"[/code] Good 4D model Binary file. This checks the magic number, meaning f the file extension is not correct, the file will be read correctly anyway.

		<member name="compression_format" type="int" setter="set_compression_format" getter="get_compression_format" enum="G4MFDocument4D.CompressionFormat" default="0">
			The compression format to use when exporting a binary G4MF file or byte array. This only applies to the chunks of the [code]".g4b"[/code] Good 4D model Binary file format, or in-memory byte arrays. The [code]".g4tf"[/code] Good 4D model Text File format is always uncompressed. See [enum CompressionFormat] for the available formats. The default is [constant COMPRESSION_FORMAT_NONE], which does not compress the G4MF data.

			How to deal with nested Godot scenes when exporting to G4MF, and how to deal with nested G4MF models when importing as a Godot scene. See the [G4MFModel4D] class for more information.
			- The default is [code]-1[/code], which allows unlimited nested G4MF models to be created when exporting, and allows nested G4MF models to create unlimited nested Godot scenes when importing. This allows for a deep hierarchy of files used by each other, and can result in significant file size savings if a Godot scene contains another Godot scene instanced many times, at the cost of the added complexity of multiple model files.
			- A value of [code]0[/code] will merge all nested Godot scenes into a single G4MF model when exporting, and merge all nested G4MF models into a single Godot scene when importing.
			- A value of [code]1[/code] will merge nested Godot scenes into one layer of G4MF models when exporting, and merge nested G4MF models into one layer of Godot scenes when importing. Similarly, increasing values limit the depth of nested scenes/models to those amounts.
			On import, the only case where a nested G4MF model will marked as an instance of separate file is when the file is in the [code]res://[/code] folder, and only during editor import. If referencing a file outside of the [code]res://[/code] folder, or embedded in the parent G4MF, or when importing a file at runtime, that file's nodes will be merged into the imported Godot scene.
			[b]Note:[/b] The G4MF specification's name uniqueness guarantee does not apply to nested G4MF models. When using nested G4MF models, the names of nodes in the nested G4MF models may not be unique when considering the entire node tree of the parent G4MF model. For example, two characters stored in separate models may both have a node named "Hips". When merging nested scenes into a single G4MF model, the names of nodes in the nested G4MF models will be forced to be unique.
