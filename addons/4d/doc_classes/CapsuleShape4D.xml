		A 4D capsule shape.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		CapsuleShape4D describes a 4D capsule using a [member height] and [member radius]. The capsule is centered at the origin. The height spans vertically along the Y axis; if you want a capsule facing a different direction, you can rotate the [CollisionShape4D] node the capsule is attached to.
		When a 4D capsule is viewed directly from the top or bottom, it appears as a 3D sphere, with the center of the sphere closer to the viewer. This is similar to how a 3D capsule appears as a 2D circle when viewed from the top or bottom, with the center of the circle closer to the viewer.

		<member name="height" type="float" setter="set_height" getter="get_height" default="2.0">
			The full height of the capsule in meters in the Y direction, including the hemispheres at both ends. This is the value that is stored internally.
		</member>
		<member name="mid_height" type="float" setter="set_mid_height" getter="get_mid_height">
			The mid height of the capsule in meters in the Y direction, excluding the hemispheres at both ends. This is a wrapper around [member height] and [member radius] for situations where you want to use the mid height instead of the full height.
		</member>
		<member name="radius" type="float" setter="set_radius" getter="get_radius" default="0.5">
			The radius of the capsule in meters in the XZW directions. This is the value that is stored internally.
