		Custom 4D wireframe mesh class.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		ArrayWireMesh4D is a class for specifying wireframe meshes with arrays of data, including the vertices and edges. Unlike the specialized [WireMesh4D] classes such as [BoxWireMesh4D], ArrayWireMesh4D can store any wireframe mesh, allowing users to create custom meshes with arbitrary data.

			<description>
				Merges this wireframe mesh with another wireframe mesh. The other mesh's vertices and edges are added to this mesh. The [param offset] and [param basis] parameters are used to transform the other mesh's vertices before adding them to this mesh. This is useful for combining meshes that are in different positions or orientations.
				This method will also attempt to merge the materials of the two meshes, by calling [method Material4D.merge_with] on this mesh's material and passing the other mesh's material as an argument. See [method Material4D.merge_with] for more information.

		<member name="edge_indices" type="PackedInt32Array" setter="set_edge_indices" getter="get_edge_indices" default="PackedInt32Array()">
			The indices of the edges. Every 2 integers defines an edge. Each integer is an index to the [member vertices] array. Integers in this array should not exceed the length of the vertices array, or else the mesh is invalid.
		</member>
		<member name="vertices" type="PackedVector4Array" setter="set_vertices" getter="get_vertices" default="PackedVector4Array()">
			The vertices of the wireframe mesh. Each Vector4 in this array is a vertex defined as a position in meters in 4D space. The items in this array are referenced by the [member edge_indices] array.
