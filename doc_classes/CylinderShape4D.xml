		A 4D cylinder shape.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		CylinderShape4D describes a 4D cylinder, also known as a spherinder, using a [member height] and [member radius]. The spherinder shape is like a 4D capsule, but with the end "hemispheres" removed. The cylinder is centered at the origin. The height spans vertically along the Y axis; if you want a cylinder facing a different direction, you can rotate the [CollisionShape4D] node the cylinder is attached to.
		When a 4D cylinder is viewed directly from the top or bottom, it appears as a flat 3D sphere, and when viewed from the side, it appears to be a cuboid. This is similar to how a 3D cylinder appears as a 2D circle when viewed from the top or bottom, and as a rectangle when viewed from the side.
